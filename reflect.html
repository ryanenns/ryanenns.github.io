                    <p>
                        Responsive design refers to the ability of a web page to be rendered to multiple different devices. Typically this occurs by measuring the width of the screen that the web page is being rendered to, and changing the layout depending on that value. In my research, I learned that CSS uses the @media query to change the style of a web page based on any value inserted, again, typically width.

                    <h2 class="resdes" id="hea2">How does Responsive Design relate to web tech?</h2>
                    <p>In order for a website to be properly usable on many devices and monitor sizes, responsive design must be taken into account. Take, for example, YouTube. While watching a YouTube video, if you resize your window there are two primary layouts that it adopts depending on your screen size. Either recommended videos are on the right of the screen, or underneath the video playing. Upon further shrinking of the window, things like the view count gets abbreviated from a full number to a shorthand (eg. 123,456 to 123k). Web pages that take advantage of responsive design are more accessible to users on varying platforms and devices, which is crucial for a website to function properly in 2020.</p>

                    <h2 class="resdes">What techniques did you utilize in responsive design?</h2>
                    <p>I primarily utilized the @media query, based on minimum and maximum screen widths to define differing CSS rules for HTML elements, better suiting the website for smaller or larger screens</p>

                    <h2 class="resdes">What did you learn about building web pages for different devices?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I learned that websites resize based on window size, and that’s about all. I expected websites to identify the device that’s being used to access the website and apply different styles for each device. I guess that resizing based on width is a lot faster and more convenient.
